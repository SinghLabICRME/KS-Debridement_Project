## Genome-Wide DNA Hypermethylation in the Wound-1 Edge of Chronic Wound Patients Opposes Closure by Impairing Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition

## Abstract
Unbiased whole-genome methylome was studied in the wound-edge (WE) tissue of chronic wound
patients. Methylation status of proximal promoter (1Kb) was calculated using MethylCap-Seq and
PrEMeR-CG data analyses. A total of 4689 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were
identified in chronic WE compared to unwounded (UW) human skin. Hypermethylation was more
frequently observed (3661 DMRs) in the chronic WE compared to hypomethylation (1028 DMRs).
Twenty-six hypermethylated DMRs were involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Bisulfite sequencing validated hypermethylation of a predicted specific upstream regulator TP53.
Whole genome RNA sequencing analysis was performed to qualify findings from methylome
analysis. Hierarchical clustering analyses identified a large set of genes, the expression of which
were significantly downregulated in chronic WE compared to UW skin. Analysis of the
downregulated genes identified the TP53 signaling pathway, including P63, P73, FOXO3, SIRT1
and HDAC1, as being significantly silenced. Direct comparison of hypermethylation and
downregulated gene expression identified four genes, ADAM17, NOTCH, TWIST1 and SMURF1,
that were common to both data sets and functionally represented the EMT pathway. Single cell
RNA sequencing studies identified that these effects on gene expression were limited to the
keratinocyte cell compartment. Experimental murine studies established that tissue ischemia
potently induces WE gene methylation and that 5â€™-azacytidine, inhibitor of methylation, improves
wound closure. To specifically address the significance of TP53 methylation, keratinocyte-specific
editing of TP53 methylation at the WE was achieved by a CRISPR/dCas9 approach involving K14
promoter-driven TP53 guide RNAs. Such in vivo gene editing rescued ischemic wound healing.
This work identified that reversal of methylation-dependent keratinocyte gene-silencing represents
a productive therapeutic strategy to improve wound closure.
